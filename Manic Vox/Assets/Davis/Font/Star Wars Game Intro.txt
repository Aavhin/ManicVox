A long time ago, in a galaxy far,
far away....

Luke Skywalker received a message,
while cleaning the droid R2D2, 
from princes Leia
“...help me Obi-Wan Kanobe,
 you’re my only hope...”.

He has decided to help her. However,
he  has lost his force needed to 
light-up  the  lightsaber.

The  only other option,
to  light-up  the  lightsaber,
is  to  use  batteries
and each battery only lasts for 
a finite amount of time.

Thus, he continuously needs
to pick up batteries along
the way to keep the lightsaber working.

Of course,
there will be enemies 
attacking him along the way
to rescue princess Leia.
